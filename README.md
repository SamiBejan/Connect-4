# Connect-4
This project resembles the popular game "Connect 4". Two players place their pieces succesively on the game rack and the first one that creates a line of 4 pieces of their color is the winner. <br/>

It took me 24 hours to create this project. <br/>

The most challenging functionality was checking if the game was won by the current player after a new piece was added. From the new piece position, I checked the four axes (vertical, horizontal, diagonals) with the help of multiple repeat loops. 
If one of these axes contains a sequence of four or more consecutive cells of the current player color, the game is won. <br/>

In the following video I explained how I created the project:
